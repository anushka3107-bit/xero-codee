⭐ Challenges Faced

👽 The Main Challenge was to implement Typescript in the project.
👽 When using Next.js for SSR, i had to make sure that the server-rendered components was type-safe, 
and data fetched on the server is properly typed this was quite hard for me in the begining.
👽 Integrating TypeScript with state management libraries was challenging too for me.
